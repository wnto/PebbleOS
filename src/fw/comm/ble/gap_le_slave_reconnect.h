//! bonded master device AND the local device is not already connected as slave.
//! The interface of the sub-system is merely a set of handlers to respond to
//! changes in slave connectivity and bonding.

//! Stops advertising for reconnection. For example, for when a connection to a
//! master gets established (only one master allowed in BT 4.0)
void gap_le_slave_reconnect_stop(void);

//! Start advertising for reconnection, but only if there is a bonded master
//! device. Otherwise, this is a no-op. In case the sub-system is already
//! advertising for reconnection, this function is a no-op.
//! Events for which this function should be called:
//! - When a connection to a master is lost
//! - When the list of bonded devices changes
//! - When Bluetooth is turned on
//! When still connected as slave, advertising starts once that connection is gone.

//! To be called when the connection as slave is gone.
